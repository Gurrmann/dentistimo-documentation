## Software Requirement Specification (SRS):

### Functional Requirements
1. A user shall be able to book a dentist appointment. <br>
  1.1. The user shall be able to view a selected date and it’s available time slots. <br>
  1.2. The user shall be prompted to fill in a form after selecting an available time slot. <br>
  1.3. When an appointment is successfully booked a confirmation message is returned by the system. <br>
  1.4. When an appointment fails to book a rejection message is returned by the system. <br>
  1.5. When a form has been completed, the user shall get a prompt booking successfully.
2. The system shall display dentistries on a map of Gothenburg. <br>
  2.1. The user shall be able to navigate the map by dragging and zooming. <br>
  2.2. The system shall display all dentistries on the map. <br>
  2.3. The system shall allow users to select a dentistry on the map. <br>
  2.4. When a user selects a dentistry on the map, information on the dentistry will show up.

### Non-Functional Requirements

  1.1. Most of users understand the UI within 1 minute
2. The system does not crash.

## Software Architecture Document (SAD):

### The main forces that drive our system are:


### Availability
This system is being developed because there was found to be a need for a system that let users quickly and easily see available dentistries in one place. This makes availability a force that drives this system.

### Reliability
The dentistimo system should be highly stable since the quantity of both dentist and patient is huge. Pipe and Filter architecture filters the inappropriate data and prevents breakdowns because of errors from subsystems.
The system has a constraint that each component must be able to handle standard errors such as incorrectly formatted data, this means that reliability is a force that must drive our system. The publish and subscribe style is limited in how it guarantees deliveries since it uses different levels of quality of services where the more reliable options cost more bandwidth and therefore lower performance, however we choose to prioritize reliability for this project.

## Software Architecture
We intend to use a mix of different software architecture styles. The architecture styles we are planning on using are Client/Server style, Publish Subscribe, as well as Pipe and Filter. Client/Server will be used in order to receive the latest data from the dentistry repository. Publish Subscribe is used as the way we communicate between components, and Pipe and Filter will be used when filtering json data, making sure format is correct

Our plan is to base the backend of our web application on node.js, and use Mongoose to connect our backend to our mongodb database. The backend will be used to read and write from/to the database, it will then publish the data to the broker, which in turn communicates with the rest of the components who are subscribed.
We have decided on using the MQTT.js library.

We will use the JS framework react to create the user interface
